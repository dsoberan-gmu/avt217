				<h1>Nintendo Power Magazine Mockup</h1>
				<h2>Recreation of an old school video game magazine!</h2>

				<p>During the fall semester of 2020, I was taking an online digital design class. The final project was for us to design a mockup magazine of our choice. It could be any magazine we want such as TIMES, Rollingstone, Vogue, etc. Since I am a video game programmer, I thought of designing a video game magazine. Game Informer and GameStop makes magazines these days but I wanted to go a bit old school. Nintendo Power magazines were very popular in the 1980s and 1990s with showcasing their games and exclusive content that would not see in games or other magazines (before the internet became universal). I themed it after Mario's 35th anniversary and detailed the history of Mario in two pages. It was a fun final project that I am glad I did.</p>
