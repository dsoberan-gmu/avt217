		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p><img src="images/daniels_image.jpg" alt="Me">Daniel Soberanis-Chacon is a game programmer who works with Robert Dietrich to be a build manager for a game in our Advanced Game Design Studio class at George Mason University. Daniel knows how to program using C# and python. He loves to program because multiple solutions can work in programming certain functions in a game. If one method doesn’t work the way he was hoping, he will try a different method. Daniel will be working for MGTA as an instructor for Python AI and Machine Learning for his summer internship.</p>
