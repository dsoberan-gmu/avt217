<h1>Web Critique</h1>

<h2><img src="images/cnn.PNG" alt=" " width="750" height="500"><br>CNN</h2>
<p>CNN can be a useful source of information around the world on television. However, not everyone will get their news on television. Most will try to find out the news on their computer or smartphones. Finding the information you want to know about is very simple. People can find it on the homepage or type on the search bar to find the article or video they want to learn more about. Videos and articles contain very useful information that takes the beauty underneath approach well. Headers are clear and make it easy for people to understand the subject of the matter. Color is simple however the grids are a little unorganized. This makes it cluttered to pack in so much information. Other than that, the site satisfies everyone's needs and people will find themselves revisiting this page in 5 years.</p>

<h2><img src="images/microsoft.PNG" alt=" " width="750" height="500"><br>Microsoft</h2>
<p>It can be tricky to find quality and affordable technology in person. The people in many electronic stores will either have the product you want or not. Online purchases rarely have that excuse. Finding the information on the type of technology you want is simple. Not only can you buy the tech you want, but it provides detailed specs on what they do and why you should buy the product. Clear headers for people to find the tech they want. Color is simple and the grid is organized. It is not cluttered and it is easy to find information on the technology they have. The site satisfies people's needs and people may continue returning to this site in 5 years.</p>

<h2><img src="images/buzzfeed.PNG" alt=" " width="750" height="500"><br>Buzzfeed</h2>
<p>This is almost like CNN, however, it is more diverse and has a slightly cleaner design than CNN. People will find information about the world going on not just in politics, but in sports, television shows, movies, etc. Clear headers to summarize an article. Hardly any color going on in this website and while the design is clean, the layout and grids are still not the best for arranging the links to the articles. Not cluttered as CNN, however, it could be organized better. While this site can still satisfy people's needs, I don't think people will be going to this website as frequently as other news sources. Others are a bit more professional while this one feels like something from a blog.</p>

<h2><img src="images/amazon.PNG" alt=" " width="750" height="500"><br>Amazon</h2>
<p>Millions of people go on this website for good reasons. Whatever you think of, amazon will always have what you want. They sell computers, video games, books, accessories, films, etc. Amazon even has a streaming service called Amazon prime where you rent or buy movies or series. Amazon indeed has anything you want. People can access their needs through the menu on the top and the search bar. Some people hardly use the search bar because many of the products are easy to find through many the popularity aspect. The website is well designed with the tone of the color and the grid-based design. Nothing is cluttered and the products provide just enough information for whatever item the consumer wants. It is a great website to shop online and people will continue to come back to this site within 5 years.</p>

<h2><img src="images/bestbuy.PNG" alt=" " width="750" height="500"><br>Best Buy</h2>
<p>I hardly go to best buy's website. I mainly go to the store to get any tech accessories I want and every time they got what I want. Other people are also in the same boat as me. The only time that many people including myself go on best buy's website is when something is not out yet and I want to pre-order it. That rarely happens since it is only with video games for me. Finding information is simple and is like amazon. They provide reviews on the products they sell. The design is simple yet a little complicated. Simple because people can look on the search bar or through the menu. Complicated because there are no specs that make people making decisions on the project difficult. While this is a good site, people will most likely not revisit this website frequently in the next 5 years. Especially with amazon's existence, it is going to be a bit difficult for them to keep the consumers motivated on staying with them.</p>
