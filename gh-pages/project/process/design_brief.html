			<h2>Research Summary</h2>
			<p>While studying many people's websites and portfolios, I tried to take into account what makes their webpages so easy, simple and appealing to the human eye. Getting straight to the point with information and images is one of the most important things to get right for any webpage. I took two courses where I had to make a portfolio of my own. However, it was a portfolio that consisted only of video game-related projects. During my four years in college, I made different types of art that I felt proud of. This portfolio will be my overall art portfolio.</p>

			<p>A lot of portfolios that I looked up are categorized with at least four separate pages besides the home page. There is the portfolio page, contact page, resume page, and an about me page. The portfolio page will be divided into 3 categories: Game Design, Digital Art, and Traditional Art. Each of my portfolio pieces will have a picture and description of what it is. The audience for this portfolio will be mainly people hiring me. Employers can view how I can make video games, digital art, and traditional art is all easily done. I want this website to be really easy to understand, access, and use by anyone no matter their skills in computers. I will need to make the website simple, clean, and creative for everyone wanting to return more than one time.</p>
